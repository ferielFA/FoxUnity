I think some of it is that the character model you’re aiming at is now two times the size. So when you start off with a good beam, then you’re going to really end them. At the same token though, if that shooting starts off badly, you not gunna reconnect without re-acquiring the target. So if it starts out as a miss, it’s never going to get back on track if you keep holding down the ADS. I used to love it for the 45 and 99. As I got better though, I found that the 1X was easier. I think 2X is kind of an easy in some ways. Very counterintuitive. Even a crutch, maybe.",
