Sources claim the new title will focus heavily on classic boots-on-the-ground gameplay, featuring simplified perks, a slower movement meta, and highly tactical combat.\r\n\r\nSeveral remastered maps from beloved older titles are expected to return, alongside a handful of new arenas built for competitive play. While Activision has yet to comment on the leaks, long-time fans are enthusiastic about the possibility of a more traditional Call of Duty experience.",
